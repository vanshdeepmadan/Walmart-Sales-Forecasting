# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
	•Built machine learning and time series models to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores, leveraging Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and statistical methods such as ARIMA and SARIMA.
 
	•Conducted data preprocessing and extensive feature engineering, including lagged features, rolling averages, holiday effects, markdown impacts, and store-specific metrics.
 
	•Tested with Linear Regression as a baseline, achieving an R² of 0.907, and demonstrated the need for advanced models to capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns.
 
	•Developed and evaluated time series forecasting models (ARIMA and SARIMA) to capture seasonality, incorporating annual trends into predictions.
 
	•Implemented Random Forest with fine-tuned parameters, achieving an R² of 0.981, leveraging ensemble learning for robust predictions.
 
	•Optimized XGBoost, achieving an R² of 0.981, capturing intricate feature interactions and seasonal effects.
 
	•Performed feature importance analysis, identifying key drivers of sales such as short-term trends (lagged features), seasonal patterns (rolling averages), and holiday promotions.
 
	•Visualized actual vs. predicted sales trends to validate model performance and highlight prediction accuracy.
 
	•Provided actionable insights into sales patterns, combining time series analysis and machine learning to address both short-term and long-term forecasting needs.
